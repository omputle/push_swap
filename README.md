# push_swap

The project was to create a sorting algorithm that sorts numbers using two stacks and the following rules:

->sa - swap the first two numbers in Stack A.
->sb - swap the first two numbers in Stack B.
->ra - take the top number in Stack A and place it at the bottom of the stack.
->rb - take the top number in Stack B and place it at the bottom of the stack.
->rra - take the bottom number in Stack A and place it at the top of the stack.
->rrb - take the bottom number in Stack B and place it at the top of the stack.
->pa - take the top number in Stack A and push it to the top of Stack B.
->pb - take the top number in Stack B and push it to the top of Stack A.
